# Analysis of Citi Bike Data in NYC August 2019

## Project Overview
We are using Tableau to analyze data from Citi Bike in order to determine if a similiar program could be opened successfully in Des Moines.

### Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis we can determine that in NYC, the majority of users are male subscribers between the ages of 25-35. An analysis of the demographics in Des Moines would be required to determine if the demorgaphics there would match with these findings. Additionally, based off the findings about peak usage times, it would appear that many users use the bikes as a mode of transport to and from work (likely to avoid the high traffic congestion of the city). Does Des Moines have similiar traffic congestion, and would this be a viable option?

In terms of a business opprotunity, this analysis only focuses on demorgaphics and usage and not on the costs associated with the business model. What are the fixed costs of each bike and station installation? What are the variable costs associated with maintaining the bikes? How much are the subscriptions per month and how much does it cost a non-subscriber for a one-time use?

## Analysis Results

With our analysis we wanted to answer three questions:

1) What is the average trip duration? Is gender a factor?

2) What time of day is the most busy? Does this change depending on day?

3) Does age play a factor in usage?

### Average Trip Duration:
Average trip duration is less than 10 minutes. While males have a much higher usage rate, the gender does not seem to have much of a factor in the ride duration.

### Busiest time of day:
The busiest time of day during weekdays is between 7:00 and 10:00 AM, and 5:00 and 7:00 PM. During the weekend, the usage is evenly spread throughout the day. Additionally, we can see that the bulk of users are male subscribers.

### Average Rider Age
Ride counts increase with age until the age of 30 and then start to decline. The bulk of riders are in their mid 20's to early 30's.
